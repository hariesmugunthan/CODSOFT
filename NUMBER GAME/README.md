This java code is about an basic number guessing game
In which a random number is generated 
And the user is subjected to guess that generated number(there is a limit to the user for guessing that number[like 10 guess])
The number guessed by the user is less than the generated number means this message appears"GUESS IS LOW"
Similarly if the guessed number is greater means "GUESS IS HIGH" message appears
The user guessde the correct number means the game ends...
